## Reflections & Learnings (Day 48-49 of #100DaysOfCode)

- Gained hands-on experience setting up a modern JavaScript project from scratch using `npm init`.
- Learned to configure `webpack.config.js` for development (`mode: 'development'`), setting up entry and output points, and using the `webpack-dev-server`.
- Practiced organizing code into separate ES6 modules for better maintainability (e.g., `home.js`, `menu.js`, `contact.js`) and importing/exporting functions.
- Solidified DOM manipulation skills by building the entire page structure with JavaScript functions instead of static HTML.
